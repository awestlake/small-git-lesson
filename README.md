## Tasks

* Create a pull request on this branch, adding your name below.
* Add a new folder and file with your name in it (of your favorite code type)
* Create an issue that specifically tags a line number with a "possible bug" that is fake
* Create a new branch with your name as the branch

It's ok if you don't know how to do any of these. That is what you are finding out now. Google around for this. Tooling allowed (aka if you want to use GitKraken or SourceTree you are more than encouraged to do so).

## Names:

* Logan
